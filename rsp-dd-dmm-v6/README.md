## New Design
Here we take 1024x10 rxmat and xmat and generate 181x1024 for all possible angles corresponding to doppler angles. This uses 64bit output. Still probably works, i guess. But for the time being 32bit output is being used. Plans to go back to 64bit are there.
So this is the old design now.
